# About

I found a very cool playlist on Code Monkey's YouTube channel which shows some pretty useful C# features to help people write cleaner code.

His lessons helped me so much that I decided to make this tutorial project explaining in detail everything I learned from his advanced C# videos. This way, if I happen to forget something about them, I will quickly remind it by revisiting this project.

As always, if you have any interest in this topic, feel free to take a look at my notes too!
